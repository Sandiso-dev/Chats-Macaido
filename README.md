# Chats-Macaido
A chat app where a user can create an account with a profile picture, able to search relatives and friends to chat with in real time.
This app is by far the biggest,challenging and yet educatic project i have built since my coding journey began, I learnt a lot while building it,.
The app is built with React.js, Vite.js, Sass for styling and Firebase as my backend managing all the authentication process and data storing,
which was the most helpful platform in my production at about 80% of the app is built with firebase methods and which wwas a learning curve 
for me whith the help of  their Docs i managed to pull through. In react for statemanagement i used context Api and a little bit of slice,used and external library 
for creating unique ID for every user which is calld UUID
